# Machine-Learning 
This repository contains notes on my journey of building my machine learning skills. I am going to try and summarize the different methods and courses that I have used to learn the subject.  I started with Andrew NG's course on coursera and in my opinion thats one of the best to get started if you have a MATLAB background. It covers the basics of most of the ML learning concepts to build a strong foundation. Once , I finished this course , from my research I found out that Python is one of the most widely used tool for ML, and hence I needed to learn it. For learning Python I mainly used  https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook. Along, with this I started another advanced course on regression which is part of Data Science specialization from University of washington on coursera. The assignments in this course used a house sales dataset from Kings County where Seattle is located.It gave me hands on experience on learning various methods ued in making predictions about the data such as Ridge & Lasso resgression, bias-variance tradeoff, using cross-validation for parameter selection,non-parametric methods such as KNN & Kernal regression and Loss functions. It also gave me a hands-on experience on using  GraphLab Create and numpy arrays and implementing algorithms like gradient and coordinate descent.
